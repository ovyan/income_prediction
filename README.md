# income_prediction
A jupyter-notebook project with data preparation, analysis and training.

The problem of classification of people’s income had been a thorny issue for many banks until Machine Learning was introduced to the world. I decided to solve this known task myself. For my project I took the data-set ‘Adult Data Set’ from UCL Machine Learning Repository. It contains information about working people and aged between 16 to 60 gathered in 1994 in the US. There are around 32,000 rows, each containing the following information about the person:

	•	Age: a number	
	•	Workclass: information about type of the job (self-employed and etc.)
	•	Education: educational degree
	•	Education-num: educational degree converted to number
	•	Marital-status: type of marriage, if it even exists
	•	Occupation: place of the job
	•	Relationship: current relationship status
	•	Race: race of the person
	•	Sex: sex of the person
	•	Capital-gain: a number
	•	Capital-loss: a number
	•	Hours-per-week: working our per week
	•	Native-country: country of the origin
	•	Money: person’s income
